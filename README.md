# Flood-Detection
## Project Structure
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Historical rainfall data is loaded and inspected.
The dataset includes columns for rainfall amounts by month and a binary flood occurrence indicator.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizations and statistical analysis are performed to understand the data distribution and identify patterns.
Analysis includes monthly and annual rainfall trends, as well as flood occurrence frequencies.
## Modeling:

Machine learning models are implemented to predict flood occurrence based on rainfall data.
Models evaluated may include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and others to identify the most accurate method.
## Results and Conclusion:

Performance of the models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
The project concludes with insights on which model performs best for flood prediction.
